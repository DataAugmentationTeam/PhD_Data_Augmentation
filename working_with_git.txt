Heres how I configured your git so that you could clone and write to our repository:
1. We needed to generate a personal access token in Settings->Developer Settings->Personal Access Tokens->Tokens. For the settings just click on "Repo"  You then saved this token in a notes document for later use.
2. I added you to our organization, DataAugmentationTeam, as an Owner, and I added you to the repository PhD_Data_Augmentation with write access.
3. On your computer you made sure your credentials were correctly stored using "git config --global user.name <username>" and "git config --global user.email <email>", replacing <username> and <email> with your Github account username and email.
4. You cloned the repository using git clone https://github.com/DataAugmentationTeam/PhD_Data_Augmentation, giving your username, and when it asks for a password giving the token generated earlier.

Now that you're able to access the repository, there are 5 steps to do whenever you have new work you want to upload:

1. Navigate to the cloned repository in your documents using the Terminal.
2. Enter the command "git pull". This will bring anything new from the repository into your local version.
3. Enter the command "git add .". This will add any new documents from your side.
4. Enter the command "git commit -m "<your message about what you did here>". This will stage those added documents for upload.
5. enter the command "git push origin main". This will upload your committed files to the repository!

As a test, perhaps try creating a new file in your local location and push it to the repository using the 5 steps above.
