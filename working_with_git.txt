The first time you want to host a GitHub repository locally in your documents, you can clone it. You do this by typing 
"git clone LINK_TO_REPOSITORY". For example for our repository it will be git clone 
https://github.com/joshuandwilliams/PhD_Data_Augmentation.

To do so you need to have write access to that repository. When we met Friday 10th Nov I worked out how to give you access:
1. We needed to generate a personal access token in Settings->Developer Settings->Personal Access Tokens->Fine-grained Tokens. You then saved this token in a notes document for later use.
2. I added you as a collaborator on the repository.
3. You cloned the repository using git clone https://<username><personal_access_token>@github.com/joshuandwilliams/PhD_Data_Augmentation (replacing <username> and <personal_access_token>). For some 
reason this only worked when the repository was public.

Now that you're able to access the repository, there are 5 steps to do whenever you have new work you want to upload:

1. Navigate to the cloned repository in your documents using the Terminal.
2. Enter the command "git pull". This will bring anything new from the repository into your local version.
3. Enter the command "git add .". This will add any new documents from your side.
4. Enter the command "git commit -m "<your message about what you did here>". This will stage those added documents for upload.
5. enter the command "git push origin main". This will upload your committed files to the repository!

As a test, perhaps try creating a new file in your local location and push it to the repository using the 5 steps above.
